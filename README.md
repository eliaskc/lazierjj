# kajji

> The rudder for your jj

A simple terminal UI for (Jujutsu)](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj), inspired by [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit). Built with [OpenTUI](https://github.com/sst/opentui) and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

> Disclaimer: almost all code in this project has been written by coding agents (primarily Claude through [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)).

While learning jj I found myself coming back to lazygit to view diffs and traverse the changes I'd made quickly and easily, which has become increasingly important to me with the rise of coding agents. While there are better and more feature-rich jj TUIs, I found none quite gave me a painfree experience for this primary use case.

kajji is my attempt to bring the simplicity and polish of lazygit to jj, while also letting me experiment with using coding agents to a greater extent, building a TUI for the first time and getting more familiar with jj in the process.

## Principles

- **Polish & simplicity** — Do less, but do it well.
- **Intuitive UX** — Sensible defaults, consistent patterns.
- **Snappy** — If it feels slow, it's a bug.

## Features

- **Full-color diffs** - Works with your configured diff tool (difftastic, delta, etc.)
- **Commit log** - Navigate jj's graph with vim-style keybindings
- **Bookmarks panel** - Browse bookmarks with drill-down into commits and files
- **File tree** - Collapsible folders, file status colors (A/M/D)
- **Theming** - Multiple themes (lazygit-style, opencode-style) with terminal adaptation
- **Searchable help** - Press `?` for all keybindings, with fuzzy search

## Installation

> **Requirements**: [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [jj](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj)

```bash
# npm
npm install -g kajji

# bun
bun install -g kajji

# pnpm
pnpm add -g kajji

# or run directly
bunx kajji
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliaskc/kajji.git
cd kajji
bun install
